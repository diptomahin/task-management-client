                        <span className="font-semibold"> Automate the mundane: <br /></span> Let the robots handle the boring stuff. Automate recurring tasks, set reminders, and receive notifications so you can focus on what truly matters. <br />
                        <span className="font-semibold">Customize your path: <br /></span> No one-size-fits-all approach here. Design your workspace to suit your unique needs and preferences. Choose your view, personalize your settings, and turn SmartTask into your productivity haven. <br />
